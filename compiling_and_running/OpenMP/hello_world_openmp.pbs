# This is a comment that is just for humans to read
# Lines starting with #PBS are instructions to the scheduler

# Select the queue you want:
#PBS -q express

# Request the number of nodes and the number of
# processors per node
# OpenMP programs can use multiple processors in one node
# but cannot use more than one node
# this is called shared memory parallelism
#PBS -l nodes=1:ppn=12
  
# Request the maximum time that your job could possibly need
#PBS -l walltime=10:00

#  This line puts all the output that would have gone to the screen
#  into a single file.  Some schedulers do this by default.
#PBS -j oe

#  This makes sure your job starts in the same directory as
#  where you submitted the job.
cd $PBS_O_WORKDIR

# This is the command to run the program
./hello_world_openmp
